The code associated with the project is organized as follows:
- Data augmentation (from images directly, locally): data_augmenting.py
- Creation of datasets (from previous images stored at the following git - https://gitlab.binets.fr/paul.calot-plaetevoet/plantpathology_2020.git): creatingDatasets.ipynb
- Development of architectures. The selected notebooks are as follows:
- resnet50.ipynb
- googlenet.ipynb
- vgg16.ipynb
- efnetb3.ipynb
- processing_resnet50_definitive.ipynb
- processing_resnet50_3classes.ipynb

A drive with the following datasets, in torch.dataset format, is also available at the following address: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xTUMQhu-JbkTSriWoLJxmJXrj5jnrKym?usp=sharing

- Testing sets:
- testing_set_3classes
- testing_set_1400 (77-23% split)
- testing_set_60 (60-40% split)

- Training sets:
- dataset_8 (77-23% split)
- dataset_4 (77-23% split)
- dataset_6 (60-40% split)
- dataset_3classes (77-23% split)
- dataset_0 (77-23 split)

Whether on the git or on the drive, not all the datasets created are available: for reasons of available memory, we have only put the most relevant.
